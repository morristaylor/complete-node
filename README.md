# complete-node
## A repo to track my progress in Andrew Mead and Rob Percival's ["The Complete Node.js Developer Course (2nd Edition)"](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/ "The Complete Node.js Developer Course")

#### notes-node is a simple notes command line note taking app that takes user input and saves the notes to a local JSON file.

#### weather-app is a command line weather app that takes user input (location/ZIP) and returns current weather conditions. This app uses the Dark Sky and Google Geolocation APIs.

#### node-web-server is a web server built with Express and Handlebars. On October 28, 2018, I moved the remainder of the work for this app to [its own repo](https://github.com/morristaylor/node-web-server) so I could deploy it to the web using Heroku.

#### node-tests is an exercise in testing with Mocha.
